## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [x] Build process completes without errors
- [x] All dependencies are up to date and secure
- [x] Environment variables are properly configured
- [x] Bundle size is optimized
- [x] Security vulnerabilities are addressed

### Production Environment Setup
- [ ] Set actual `GEMINI_API_KEY` value in production environment
- [ ] Configure proper `DATABASE_URL` for production database
- [ ] Set up HTTPS certificate
- [ ] Configure CDN if needed
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Verify application loads correctly
- [ ] Test critical user flows
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Verify Arabic RTL layout
- [ ] Test print functionality
- [ ] Validate data loading from JSON bundle

## Recommendations

### Performance
1. **CDN Implementation**: Consider serving assets from CDN for global users
2. **Service Worker**: Implement PWA features for offline functionality
3. **Image Optimization**: Compress logo.png and add WebP variants
4. **Data Loading**: Consider lazy loading for large patient data sets

### Security
1. **Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP headers
2. **API Key Management**: Use environment-specific API keys
3. **Database Security**: Ensure production database has proper access controls
4. **Regular Updates**: Establish schedule for dependency updates

### Monitoring
1. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement Core Web Vitals tracking
2. **Error Tracking**: Set up error logging and monitoring
3. **Usage Analytics**: Track user engagement and feature usage
4. **Health Checks**: Implement application health endpoints

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified
- `/vite.config.ts` - Enhanced build optimization with smart chunking

### Created
- `/.env.example` - Environment variables template
- `/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_REPORT.md` - This deployment report

## Conclusion
